    To find the integral of a function, we need to apply the appropriate integration rule or technique. The most commonly used integration rules include the power rule, the sum rule, the product rule, and the chain rule. Additionally, integration by substitution and integration by parts are also frequently employed.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The power rule states that the integral of \(x^n\) is \(\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\), where \(n\) is a rational number. The sum rule allows us to integrate the sum of two or more functions by integrating each function separately and then adding the results. The product rule is used to integrate the product of two functions, and the chain rule is applied when integrating a composite function.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Integration by substitution involves replacing a part of the integrand with a new variable, while integration by parts is a technique used to integrate the product of two functions by expressing one of them as the derivative of another function. By utilizing these rules and techniques, we can find the integrals of various functions and solve a wide range of integration problems.
