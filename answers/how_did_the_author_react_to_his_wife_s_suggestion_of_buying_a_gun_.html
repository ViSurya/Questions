    The author was taken aback by his wife's suggestion of buying a gun. He found it absurd and unnecessary, considering their peaceful neighborhood and lack of any apparent threats. He tried to reason with her, emphasizing that a gun would only escalate potential conflicts and pose a danger to themselves and others.
