    Half-life is the time taken for the concentration of a reactant to reduce to half of its initial value in a first-order reaction. It is independent of the initial concentration because the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. This means that the rate of the reaction will be the same regardless of the initial concentration, and therefore, the time taken for the concentration to reduce to half of its initial value will also be the same.
