    Dearest Reema,
    I hope this letter finds you in high spirits. I am writing to share some exciting news with you. My sister, [Sister's Name], is getting married on [Date] at [Venue]. I know how close you are to my sister, and I would be thrilled if you could join us on this special day.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The wedding ceremony will be followed by a reception, where we will have a chance to celebrate and dance the night away. I know you have a busy schedule, but I hope you can make it. Your presence would mean the world to me and my family.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Please let me know if you can attend by [RSVP Date]. I can't wait to see you there!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    With love,
    [Your Name]
  </p>
