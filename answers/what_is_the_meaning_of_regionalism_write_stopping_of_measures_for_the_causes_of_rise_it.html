    Regionalism refers to the tendency of people in a particular region to identify with and prioritize the interests of their region over those of the nation as a whole. It can lead to tensions and conflicts between different regions within a country.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    To address the causes of regionalism, it is important to promote national unity and integration, ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, address regional disparities, and encourage dialogue and cooperation among different regions.
