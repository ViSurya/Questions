    India is a land of festivals, each with its own unique significance and traditions. Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country. People decorate their homes with lights, diyas, and rangolis, and exchange gifts and sweets. Holi, the festival of colors, is another popular festival that is celebrated with great joy and revelry. People smear each other with colored powder and water, and dance to the beats of dhol and nagada. Dussehra, the festival of victory, marks the triumph of good over evil. People burn effigies of Ravana, the demon king, and celebrate the victory of Lord Rama.
