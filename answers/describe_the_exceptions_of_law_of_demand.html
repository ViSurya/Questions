    The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    These exceptions include:

    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Giffen goods:</b> These are goods for which demand increases as the price increases. This can happen when a good is a necessity and consumers have no close substitutes.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Veblen goods:</b> These are goods for which demand increases as the price increases. This can happen when a good is considered a luxury item and consumers want to show off their wealth.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Complementary goods:</b> These are goods that are used together. When the price of one complementary good increases, the demand for the other complementary good also increases.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Substitute goods:</b> These are goods that can be used in place of each other. When the price of one substitute good increases, the demand for the other substitute good also increases.
