    The poem's extract highlights the unfortunate situation of individuals who are being forcibly evicted from their homes and communities. The phrase "pitiful kin" evokes a sense of empathy and compassion for these individuals, who are facing displacement and uncertainty about their future. The use of the word "mercifully" suggests that the authorities are attempting to present the eviction as an act of kindness, while the reality is that it is causing immense suffering and disruption to the lives of those affected.
