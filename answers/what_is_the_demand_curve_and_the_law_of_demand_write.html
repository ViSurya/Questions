    The demand curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded by consumers. The law of demand states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded is due to several factors, including the substitution effect, the income effect, and the law of diminishing marginal utility.
