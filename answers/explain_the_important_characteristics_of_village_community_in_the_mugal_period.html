    During the Mugal Period, village communities exhibited distinct characteristics. These communities were largely self-sufficient, with a strong sense of unity and cooperation among its members. The village panchayat, or council, played a crucial role in decision-making and resolving disputes within the community. Agriculture was the primary occupation, and land was collectively owned and cultivated. The village also had artisans and craftsmen who provided essential services to the community.
