    The Tiger King maintained his kingdom through a combination of strength, cunning, and diplomacy. He used his physical prowess and fighting skills to intimidate potential challengers and maintain control over his territory. Additionally, he employed strategic alliances with other animals, such as the monkeys, to bolster his power and influence. Furthermore, he displayed a keen understanding of the political landscape and used diplomacy to negotiate favorable terms with neighboring kingdoms, ensuring their cooperation and preventing conflicts.
