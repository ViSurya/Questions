    As a child, Bama was fascinated by the world around her and had a keen interest in observing and understanding the lives of people from different backgrounds and cultures. She was particularly drawn to the stories and experiences of marginalized communities, and she developed a strong desire to use her writing to amplify their voices and bring attention to their struggles.
