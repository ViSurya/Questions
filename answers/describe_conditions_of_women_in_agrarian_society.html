    In agrarian societies, women's roles were primarily centered around domestic duties, such as cooking, cleaning, and raising children. They also played a significant role in agricultural activities, assisting men in tasks like sowing, weeding, and harvesting. Despite their contributions, women often faced limited opportunities for education, legal rights, and decision-making power, resulting in a subordinate position within the patriarchal social structure.
