    Last Monday, I visited the hospital to see my friend, who was admitted due to a sudden illness. I found him in good spirits, despite his condition, and we had a pleasant conversation, catching up on recent events and sharing stories. He expressed his gratitude for my visit and the support it provided during his stay in the hospital.
