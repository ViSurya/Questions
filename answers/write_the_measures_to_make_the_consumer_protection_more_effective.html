    To enhance consumer protection, several measures can be taken. Firstly, consumer awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate consumers about their rights and responsibilities. Secondly, consumer courts should be strengthened and made more accessible to ensure speedy and effective redressal of grievances. Thirdly, product standards and quality control mechanisms should be strictly enforced to prevent the sale of defective or substandard goods. Additionally, consumer organizations should be supported and encouraged to play an active role in advocating for consumer rights and interests.
