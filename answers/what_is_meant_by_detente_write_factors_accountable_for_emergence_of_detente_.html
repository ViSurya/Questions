    Detente refers to a period of reduced tensions and hostilities between opposing powers, particularly during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. It involved diplomatic efforts, arms control agreements, and cultural exchanges aimed at easing tensions and preventing nuclear conflict.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Factors contributing to the emergence of Detente included the Cuban Missile Crisis, which highlighted the dangers of nuclear confrontation, the Sino-Soviet split, which weakened the communist bloc, and the rise of new leaders in both the US and the USSR who were more open to dialogue and negotiation.
