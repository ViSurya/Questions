    Gandhi's leadership in the Champaran movement exemplified several key qualities of a good leader. He demonstrated empathy by understanding the plight of the farmers and their exploitation by the British indigo planters. His strategic thinking was evident in his decision to focus on a single issue, the tinkathia system, which allowed him to mobilize mass support and negotiate effectively with the British authorities. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence and civil disobedience inspired the farmers and set a precedent for future nonviolent movements. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life and his dedication to justice and equality made him a respected and influential leader.
