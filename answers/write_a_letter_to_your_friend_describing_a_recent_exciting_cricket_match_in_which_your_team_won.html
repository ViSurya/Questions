    Hey [Friend's Name],
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    I'm writing to you today to tell you about the most exciting cricket match I've ever seen. It was last weekend, and my team, the [Team Name], won!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The match was close the whole way through, and it came down to the last over. Our team needed 10 runs to win, and we had only one wicket left. But our batsman hit a six and a four, and we won by two runs!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    It was an amazing feeling to be there and see my team win. I'm so glad I was able to experience it.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    I know you're a big cricket fan too, so I thought you'd appreciate hearing about this. I hope you're doing well. Let me know what you've been up to lately.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Talk to you soon,
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    [Your Name]
