    The speaker in the poem is trying to convey that the word "dear" has multiple meanings and can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, it can be used as a term of endearment, expressing affection or love for someone. On the other hand, it can also be used to describe something that is expensive or costly. The speaker highlights this contrast by juxtaposing the two meanings of the word in the line "Some people say that you're a dear. Yet dear is far from cheap."
