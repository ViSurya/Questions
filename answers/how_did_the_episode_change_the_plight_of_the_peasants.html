    The episode brought about significant changes in the lives of the peasants. They were granted ownership of the land they cultivated, leading to increased motivation and productivity. This resulted in improved agricultural output, ensuring food security and economic stability for the peasants and their families. Furthermore, the peasants gained a sense of dignity and empowerment as they were no longer subjected to exploitative practices and oppressive feudal systems.
