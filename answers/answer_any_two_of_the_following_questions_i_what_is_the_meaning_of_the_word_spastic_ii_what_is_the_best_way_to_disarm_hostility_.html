    (i) The word "spastic" is often used to describe a person with cerebral palsy, a condition that affects muscle tone, movement, and coordination. However, this term is considered offensive and outdated, and it is best to avoid using it.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    (ii) The best way to disarm hostility is to remain calm, respectful, and understanding. Try to see the situation from the other person's perspective and avoid becoming defensive or aggressive. Instead, focus on finding a mutually acceptable solution.
