    In the poem, the speaker describes a moment of reflection and appreciation for their mother during a drive from their parents' home to Cochin. The speaker notices their mother sitting beside them and is struck by her presence, her aging hands, and the sense of comfort and familiarity she brings. The speaker acknowledges the passage of time and the changes in their mother's appearance, but also expresses a deep love and gratitude for her.
