    Dear Preeti,
    I hope this letter finds you in high spirits. I am writing to share some exciting news with you. My elder brother, [Brother's Name], is getting married on [Date] at [Venue]. I know how close you are to our family, and I would be delighted if you could grace the occasion with your presence.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The wedding ceremony will be followed by a grand reception, where we will have a chance to catch up and celebrate together. I have attached a formal invitation along with this letter for your reference. Please let me know if you can make it so that we can make the necessary arrangements.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Your presence would mean the world to me and my family. We eagerly await your response.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Warm regards,
  </p>
