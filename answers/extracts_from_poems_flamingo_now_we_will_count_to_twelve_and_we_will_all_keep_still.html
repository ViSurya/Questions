    The line "Now we will count to twelve, and we will all keep still" is from the poem "Mid-Term Break" by Seamus Heaney. The poem reflects on the sudden and unexpected death of the poet's four-year-old brother. The line captures the moment of silence and stillness that follows the news of the tragedy, as the family and friends gather to pay their respects. The counting to twelve symbolizes the passing of time and the attempt to come to terms with the loss.
