    Douglas's fear of water stemmed from two traumatic incidents in his early life. The first occurred when he was just a toddler, when he accidentally fell into a river and nearly drowned. The second incident happened when he was a young boy, when he was caught in a sudden storm while swimming in a lake and was swept away by the strong currents. These experiences left a lasting impact on Douglas, instilling in him a deep-seated fear of water that persisted throughout his life.
