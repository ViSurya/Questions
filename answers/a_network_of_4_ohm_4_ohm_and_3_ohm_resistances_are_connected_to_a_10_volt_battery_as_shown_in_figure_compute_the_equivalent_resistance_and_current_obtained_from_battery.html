    To determine the equivalent resistance and current, we can simplify the circuit using series and parallel combinations. First, the 4 ohm and 4 ohm resistors in parallel can be combined to give a 2 ohm resistance. Then, this 2 ohm resistance is in series with the 3 ohm resistor, resulting in a total equivalent resistance of 5 ohms. Using Ohm's Law, the current obtained from the battery can be calculated as 10 volts divided by 5 ohms, which is 2 amps.
