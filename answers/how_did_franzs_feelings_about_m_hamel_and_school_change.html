    Initially, Franz was indifferent towards M. Hamel and school, finding lessons tedious and M. Hamel strict. However, as he learned about the significance of the French language and culture, and the impending Prussian annexation of Alsace, his feelings changed. He realized the value of his education and the importance of preserving his cultural identity, developing a newfound respect for M. Hamel and a sense of urgency to absorb as much knowledge as possible before the school's closure.
