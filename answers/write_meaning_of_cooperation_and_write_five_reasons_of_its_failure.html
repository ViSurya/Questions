    Cooperation is the process of working together to achieve a common goal. It involves mutual trust, understanding, and a willingness to compromise. Cooperation can be between individuals, groups, or even countries.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    There are several reasons why cooperation may fail. These include:

    <li class="mb-2">
      Lack of trust: If parties do not trust each other, they are less likely to cooperate.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      Conflicting interests: If parties have different goals, they may be unable to find a mutually acceptable solution.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      Lack of communication: If parties are unable to communicate effectively, they may misunderstand each other's intentions.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      Power imbalances: If one party has more power than the other, the weaker party may be reluctant to cooperate.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      Free riding: If one party can benefit from the cooperation without contributing, they may be tempted to free ride.
