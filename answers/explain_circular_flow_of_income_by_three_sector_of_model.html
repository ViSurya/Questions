    The circular flow of income in a three-sector model involves the interaction between households, firms, and the government. Households provide factors of production (labor, capital, and land) to firms in exchange for wages, rent, interest, and profit. Firms use these factors to produce goods and services, which they sell to households and the government. The government collects taxes from households and firms and uses this revenue to provide public goods and services. This flow of income and resources creates a circular pattern of economic activity.
