    A potentiometer is a device used to accurately measure an unknown voltage by comparing it with a known voltage source. It consists of a long resistive wire connected to a battery and a jockey (or slider) that can move along the wire. The principle of a potentiometer is based on the concept of balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage drop across a portion of the resistive wire.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    When the jockey is moved along the wire, the potential difference between the jockey and one end of the wire changes. By adjusting the position of the jockey, a point can be found where the potential difference between the jockey and the other end of the wire is equal to the unknown voltage. At this point, the potentiometer is said to be balanced.
