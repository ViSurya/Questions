    The Quit India Movement faced several challenges that contributed to its failure. Firstly, the British government's swift and decisive response, including the arrest of prominent leaders, weakened the movement's organization and coordination. Secondly, the lack of a clear and unified strategy among different sections of the Indian National Congress led to divisions and hampered the movement's effectiveness. Lastly, the outbreak of World War II diverted attention and resources away from the movement, further limiting its impact.
