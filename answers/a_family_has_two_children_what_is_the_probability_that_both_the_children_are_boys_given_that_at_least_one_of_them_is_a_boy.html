    Let E be the event that both children are boys and B be the event that at least one child is a boy. We know that P(B) = 3/4, since there are three equally likely outcomes: (boy, boy), (boy, girl), and (girl, boy). Given that at least one child is a boy, the probability that both children are boys is given by P(E|B).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    P(E|B) = P(B|E) * P(E) / P(B)
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Since the probability of having two boys given that at least one is a boy is the same as the probability of having two boys, we have P(B|E) = P(E) = 1/4.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Substituting these values, we get:
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    P(E|B) = (1/4) * (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Therefore, the probability that both children are boys given that at least one of them is a boy is 1/3.
