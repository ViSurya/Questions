    Indifference curves are graphical representations of consumer preferences, showing combinations of two goods that yield equal satisfaction to the consumer. They possess several key characteristics:

    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Negative Slope:</b> Indifference curves typically slope downward, indicating that as the quantity of one good increases, the quantity of the other good must decrease to maintain the same level of satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Convexity:</b> Indifference curves are usually convex to the origin, implying that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between the two goods diminishes as more of one good is consumed relative to the other.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Higher Indifference Curves Represent Higher Satisfaction:</b> Indifference curves farther from the origin represent higher levels of satisfaction for the consumer.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Indifference Map:</b> A collection of indifference curves for different levels of satisfaction forms an indifference map, which provides a comprehensive picture of consumer preferences.
