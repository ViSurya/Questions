    The writer implies that Saheb is no longer in control of his own life and actions. He is now subject to the whims and demands of others, particularly those in positions of power or authority. This loss of autonomy and independence signifies a significant change in Saheb's circumstances and highlights the vulnerability and powerlessness he experiences in his current situation.
