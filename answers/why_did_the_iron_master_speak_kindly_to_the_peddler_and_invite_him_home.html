    The iron master spoke kindly to the peddler and invited him home because he felt pity for the peddler's unfortunate circumstances. He noticed that the peddler was cold and hungry, and he wanted to offer him some comfort and warmth. Additionally, the iron master was impressed by the peddler's honesty and integrity, as he had returned the iron master's lost money.
