    The princely states of Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Kashmir created problems by taking integration. Hyderabad's ruler, the Nizam, initially resisted integration but eventually acceded to India after military action. Junagadh's ruler, the Nawab, initially acceded to Pakistan but later changed his mind and joined India. Kashmir's ruler, the Maharaja, initially declared independence but later acceded to India after Pakistani forces invaded the state.
