    As a resident of 4/36 Mahal Colony Shivpuri, I, Avinash Sinha, am writing to bring to your attention the pressing issues faced by the Government Hospital in our area. The hospital, which serves as a crucial healthcare facility for the community, is severely lacking in essential facilities and is plagued by malfunctioning equipment, leading to inadequate patient care.
