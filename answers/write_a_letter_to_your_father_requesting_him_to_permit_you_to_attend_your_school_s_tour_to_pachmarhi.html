    Dear Dad,
    I hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing to request your permission to attend our school's upcoming tour to Pachmarhi. This tour is a great opportunity for me to learn about the history and culture of India, as well as to make new friends and memories.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The tour will take place from [Start Date] to [End Date], and the cost is [Cost]. I understand that this is a significant expense, but I believe that the experience will be worth it. I've been studying hard in school, and I'm confident that I'll be able to keep up with my studies while on the tour.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    I know you're busy, but I hope you'll consider my request. I promise to make the most of this opportunity and to represent our family well.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Love,
    [Your Name]
  </p>
