    To prevent and control alcohol and drug use among adolescents, it is crucial to implement comprehensive strategies that address both individual and societal factors. These measures include educating adolescents about the harmful effects of substance abuse, promoting healthy coping mechanisms, strengthening family bonds, enforcing strict laws against underage drinking and drug use, and providing accessible treatment and support services for those struggling with addiction.
