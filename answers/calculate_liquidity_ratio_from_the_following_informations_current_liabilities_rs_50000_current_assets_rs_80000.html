    The liquidity ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. It is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. In this case, the liquidity ratio is 80,000 / 50,000 = 1.6. This means that the company has 1.6 times more current assets than current liabilities, which is a good position to be in.
