    Gandhi considered the Champaran episode a turning point in his life because it marked a shift in his approach to social and political activism. It was during this episode that he first employed the strategy of Satyagraha, or nonviolent civil disobedience, which would become a defining characteristic of his leadership and philosophy. The success of the Champaran Satyagraha gave Gandhi confidence in the power of nonviolent resistance and inspired him to use it in future struggles for social justice.
