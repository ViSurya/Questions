    Let us assume that √3 is a rational number. Then, we can express it as a fraction of two integers, p and q, where q ≠ 0 and p and q have no common factors other than 1.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Squaring both sides of the equation √3 = p/q, we get 3 = p<sup>2</sup>/q<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    This implies that p<sup>2</sup> = 3q<sup>2</sup>, which means that p<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 3.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Since p<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 3, p must also be divisible by 3 (because if p were not divisible by 3, then p<sup>2</sup> would not be divisible by 3).
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Let p = 3k for some integer k. Substituting this into the equation p<sup>2</sup> = 3q<sup>2</sup>, we get (3k)<sup>2</sup> = 3q<sup>2</sup>, which simplifies to 9k<sup>2</sup> = 3q<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Dividing both sides of this equation by 3, we get 3k<sup>2</sup> = q<sup>2</sup>. This implies that q<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 3, which means that q must also be divisible by 3.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Therefore, both p and q are divisible by 3, which contradicts our assumption that p and q have no common factors other than 1.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Hence, our assumption that √3 is a rational number is false, and we can conclude that √3 is an irrational number.
