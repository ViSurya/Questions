    A transformer is a static electrical device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductorsâ€”the transformer's coils. The principle of a transformer is based on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. It consists of two or more coils of wire wrapped around a core of ferromagnetic material, such as iron. When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field in the core. This magnetic field then induces an alternating current in the secondary coil. The ratio of the number of turns in the primary coil to the number of turns in the secondary coil determines the ratio of the voltages in the two coils. Transformers can be used to increase or decrease the voltage of an alternating current.

    Transformers are classified into two main types: step-up transformers and step-down transformers. Step-up transformers increase the voltage of the alternating current, while step-down transformers decrease the voltage. Transformers are widely used in power systems to transmit electrical energy over long distances with minimal losses.
