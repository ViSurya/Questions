      <b>Cavalry:</b> Shivaji's cavalry, known as the Mavalas, were highly skilled and mobile light cavalry units. They were instrumental in surprise attacks, raids, and guerrilla warfare.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Infantry:</b> The Maratha infantry, called the Pawans, were well-trained and disciplined foot soldiers. They were equipped with swords, spears, and shields and formed the backbone of Shivaji's armies.

    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Navy:</b> Shivaji recognized the importance of naval power and established a strong navy. His ships, known as gallivats, were swift and maneuverable, allowing him to control the coastal regions and disrupt enemy supply lines.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Intelligence and Espionage:</b> Shivaji had an extensive network of spies and informants, known as the Bahirjee. They gathered intelligence, infiltrated enemy territories, and provided valuable information for military campaigns.
