      An electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes immersed in an electrolyte solution. The electrodes are connected by a metal wire, and a voltmeter is connected across the electrodes to measure the potential difference between them. The chemical reaction that takes place in the cell is called the cell reaction.

      The chemical reaction that takes place in an electrochemical cell is called the cell reaction. The cell reaction is a redox reaction, which means that it involves the transfer of electrons from one species to another. The species that loses electrons is oxidized, and the species that gains electrons is reduced.
