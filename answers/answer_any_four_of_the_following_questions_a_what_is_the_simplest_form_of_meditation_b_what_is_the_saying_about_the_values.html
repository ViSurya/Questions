    (a) The simplest form of meditation is focusing on the breath. By paying attention to the rise and fall of your breath, you can calm your mind and bring your attention to the present moment.
    (b) The saying about values is "Values are not taught, they are caught." This means that children learn values by observing the behavior of the adults in their lives.
