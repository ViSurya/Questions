    As a responsible citizen, I, Kamal, organized a campaign in my locality to raise awareness about the harmful effects of polythene bags and encourage people to adopt eco-friendly alternatives. The campaign involved distributing informative pamphlets, conducting workshops, and organizing rallies to spread the message of "Say No to Polythene Bags."
