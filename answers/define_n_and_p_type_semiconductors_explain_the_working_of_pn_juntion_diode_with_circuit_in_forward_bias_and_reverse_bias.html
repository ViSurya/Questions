    <b>N-type semiconductor:</b> In an N-type semiconductor, a small amount of a pentavalent impurity, such as arsenic or phosphorus, is added to a pure semiconductor like silicon or germanium. These impurity atoms have five valence electrons, out of which four form covalent bonds with the neighboring silicon or germanium atoms, and the fifth electron becomes free, contributing to the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    <b>P-type semiconductor:</b> In a P-type semiconductor, a small amount of a trivalent impurity, such as boron or gallium, is added to a pure semiconductor. These impurity atoms have three valence electrons, which form covalent bonds with the neighboring silicon or germanium atoms, leaving a hole or vacancy where the fourth electron would have been. These holes can move freely, carrying a positive charge, and contribute to the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor.

    <b>P-N junction diode:</b> A P-N junction diode is formed by joining a P-type semiconductor and an N-type semiconductor. When the P-type semiconductor is connected to the positive terminal of a battery and the N-type semiconductor is connected to the negative terminal, the diode is said to be forward biased. In this case, the free electrons from the N-type semiconductor and the holes from the P-type semiconductor move towards the junction, allowing current to flow through the diode. When the P-type semiconductor is connected to the negative terminal and the N-type semiconductor is connected to the positive terminal, the diode is said to be reverse biased. In this case, the free electrons and holes move away from the junction, creating a depletion region and preventing current from flowing through the diode.
