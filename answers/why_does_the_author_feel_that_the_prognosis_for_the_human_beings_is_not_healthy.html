    The author believes that the prognosis for human beings is not healthy because of several reasons. Firstly, humans have caused significant damage to the environment through activities such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. This has led to a decline in biodiversity and a loss of natural resources, which are essential for human survival. Secondly, humans are facing increasing threats from diseases, both new and old. The rise of antibiotic resistance is making it more difficult to treat infections, and pandemics like COVID-19 have shown how vulnerable we are to new diseases. Thirdly, humans are also facing social and economic challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and conflict. These challenges can lead to instability and violence, which can further harm human well-being.
