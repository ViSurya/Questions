    Douglas's experience at the YMCA pool taught him valuable lessons about racial prejudice, empathy, and the importance of standing up against injustice. He realized that the segregation of the pool was unfair and discriminatory, and he gained a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by African Americans in a segregated society. This experience inspired him to become an advocate for racial equality and to work towards creating a more just and equitable world.
