    In situations where frustration arises, it is common to observe the expression of anger directed towards a single individual in an open and apparent manner. This phenomenon can be attributed to the tendency to focus blame and responsibility on a specific person, rather than acknowledging the broader context or collective factors that may have contributed to the frustrating situation.
