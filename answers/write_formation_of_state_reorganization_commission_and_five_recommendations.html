    The States Reorganization Commission was formed in 1953 under the chairmanship of Fazl Ali to address the linguistic and administrative issues arising from the existing state boundaries in India. The commission submitted its report in 1955, recommending the reorganization of states based on linguistic, cultural, and administrative considerations.

      The commission recommended the creation of 14 states and 6 centrally administered territories.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      It suggested the merger of certain princely states with neighboring states.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      The commission also recommended the formation of linguistic states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      It proposed the creation of a separate state for Telangana, which was later formed in 2014.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      The commission's recommendations were largely accepted by the government, and the states were reorganized accordingly.
