    The circular flow of income in a two-sector model involves the continuous flow of money, goods, and services between households and firms. Households provide labor and other resources to firms in exchange for wages, rent, interest, and profits. Firms use these resources to produce goods and services, which they sell to households in exchange for money. This flow of money, goods, and services generates income for both households and firms, which is then used to purchase goods and services from each other, thus completing the circular flow.
