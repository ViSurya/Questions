    The Tiger King, whose real name was Joe Exotic, acquired his name due to his extensive collection of exotic animals, particularly tigers. He owned and operated a private zoo called the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, where he kept and bred various big cats, including tigers, lions, and bears. His flamboyant personality, controversial methods, and outspoken views on animal rights and conservation gained him notoriety and the nickname "Tiger King."
