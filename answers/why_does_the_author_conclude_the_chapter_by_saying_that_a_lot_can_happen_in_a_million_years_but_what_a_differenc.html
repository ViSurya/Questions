    The author concludes the chapter by saying that a lot can happen in a million years, but what a difference a million years makes is a matter of perspective. This is because the concept of time is relative, and what may seem like a long time to one person may be a short time to another. For example, a million years may seem like a long time to a human, but it is a relatively short time in the grand scheme of the universe.
