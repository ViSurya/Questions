    The cost function is a mathematical equation that expresses the total cost of production as a function of the quantity of output produced. It is typically represented as TC = f(Q), where TC is the total cost, Q is the quantity of output, and f is the cost function. The cost function can be divided into two components: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are those costs that do not change with the level of output, such as rent, insurance, and depreciation. Variable costs are those costs that do change with the level of output, such as the cost of raw materials, labor, and energy.
