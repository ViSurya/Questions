      <strong>Economic Marginalization:</strong> Many tribal communities are marginalized economically, with limited access to education, employment opportunities, and healthcare.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Social Discrimination:</strong> Tribal communities often face social discrimination and exclusion, leading to limited access to resources and services.

    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Loss of Traditional Lands:</strong> Tribal communities have historically been dependent on their traditional lands for sustenance and cultural practices. However, these lands are often encroached upon or acquired for development projects, leading to displacement and loss of livelihoods.
