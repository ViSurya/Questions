    Child labour deprives children of their fundamental rights to education, health, and overall development. It perpetuates poverty and inequality, and can lead to physical, psychological, and emotional harm. Eliminating child labour requires a comprehensive approach that includes legal measures, social protection, and educational opportunities, as well as addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.
