    Saheb was a young boy who was forced to wander the streets of Delhi for ragpicking due to his family's extreme poverty. His father had passed away, and his mother was unable to find work to support him and his siblings. Saheb had no choice but to scavenge for recyclable materials to sell in order to help his family survive.
