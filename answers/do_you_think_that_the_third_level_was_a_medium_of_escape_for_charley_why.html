    The third level was indeed a medium of escape for Charley. It provided him with a sense of freedom and independence that he had never experienced before. In the third level, he was able to explore his own thoughts and feelings without being judged or criticized. He was also able to connect with other people who shared his interests and passions. The third level allowed Charley to escape from the mundane and often oppressive reality of his everyday life and to create a new and more fulfilling existence for himself.
