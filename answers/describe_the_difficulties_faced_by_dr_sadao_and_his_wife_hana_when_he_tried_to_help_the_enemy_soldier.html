    Dr. Sadao and Hana faced numerous difficulties when they tried to help the enemy soldier. They had to keep his presence a secret from the authorities, which meant they couldn't seek help from the outside world. They also had to deal with the constant fear of being discovered, which put a strain on their relationship and mental well-being. Additionally, they had to find a way to provide for the soldier's needs without arousing suspicion, which was a challenging task given the limited resources they had.
