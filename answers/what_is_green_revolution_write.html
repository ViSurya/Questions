    The Green Revolution refers to the period of agricultural development that took place during the 1960s and 1970s, characterized by the introduction of high-yielding varieties of crops, increased use of fertilizers and pesticides, and improved irrigation methods. This led to a significant increase in agricultural productivity, particularly in developing countries, and helped to address food shortages and improve food security.
