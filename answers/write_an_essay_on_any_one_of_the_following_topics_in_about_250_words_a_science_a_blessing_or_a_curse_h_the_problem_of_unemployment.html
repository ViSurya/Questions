    Science has brought immense benefits to humanity, revolutionizing various aspects of our lives. However, it also poses significant risks and challenges, leading to debates about whether it is ultimately a blessing or a curse.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    On the one hand, scientific advancements have improved healthcare, communication, transportation, and access to information, enhancing our quality of life. On the other hand, the misuse of science has resulted in environmental degradation, nuclear weapons, and genetic engineering concerns, raising ethical and moral dilemmas.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Ultimately, the impact of science is a double-edged sword, and it is up to us to harness its potential responsibly and mitigate its negative consequences.
