    Dear Pushkar,
    I hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing to invite you to spend your summer vacation with me in my town. We can have a lot of fun together, exploring new places and trying out different activities.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    We can go swimming in the river, play cricket in the park, or just hang out and talk. I'm sure we'll have a great time. Let me know if you can make it.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Best regards,
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Mridul Kumar
