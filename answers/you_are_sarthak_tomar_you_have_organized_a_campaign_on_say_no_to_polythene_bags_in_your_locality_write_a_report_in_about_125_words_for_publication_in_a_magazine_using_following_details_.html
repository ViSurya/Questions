    In response to the growing environmental concerns caused by polythene bags, I, Sarthak Tomar, organized a campaign titled "Say No to Polythene Bags" in my locality. The campaign aimed to raise awareness about the harmful effects of polythene bags on the environment and encourage residents to adopt eco-friendly alternatives.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Through workshops, seminars, and door-to-door campaigns, we educated the community about the importance of reducing polythene bag usage. We distributed reusable cloth bags and jute bags as alternatives and encouraged local businesses to switch to eco-friendly packaging options.
