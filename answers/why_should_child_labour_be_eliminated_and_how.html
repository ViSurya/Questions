    Child labour is a severe problem that needs to be eliminated. It deprives children of their childhood, education, and opportunities for a better future. It also exposes them to hazardous working conditions and can lead to physical, mental, and emotional harm.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    To eliminate child labour, we need to address its root causes, such as poverty, lack of access to education, and social norms that condone it. We also need to strengthen laws against child labour and ensure that they are enforced. Additionally, we need to provide support to families and communities to help them find alternative sources of income and ensure that children have access to quality education and other essential services.
