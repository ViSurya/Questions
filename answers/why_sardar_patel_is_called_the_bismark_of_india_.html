    Sardar Patel is often referred to as the "Bismark of India" due to his significant contributions to the integration of princely states into the Indian Union after independence. Just as Otto von Bismarck played a crucial role in unifying the German states into the German Empire, Sardar Patel's efforts in bringing together over 560 princely states into the newly formed Republic of India earned him this title.
