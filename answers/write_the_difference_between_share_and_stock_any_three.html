    Shares represent ownership in a company, while stocks are the certificates that evidence ownership of those shares. Shares are typically issued when a company is first formed or when it raises additional capital, while stocks are traded on stock exchanges. Shares are typically held by individual investors, while stocks can be held by individuals, institutions, or corporations.
