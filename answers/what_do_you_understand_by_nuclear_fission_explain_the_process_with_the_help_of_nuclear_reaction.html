    Nuclear fission is a process in which a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a great amount of energy. This process is accompanied by the release of neutrons, which can then go on to split other heavy nuclei, creating a chain reaction.

    A typical nuclear fission reaction is the splitting of a uranium-235 nucleus into two smaller nuclei, such as krypton-92 and barium-141, along with the release of three neutrons and a large amount of energy.
