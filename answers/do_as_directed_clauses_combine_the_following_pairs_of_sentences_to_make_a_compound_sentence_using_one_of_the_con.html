    To combine the given pair of sentences using a conjunction, identify the relationship between the two sentences. If they are related by addition, use a coordinating conjunction like "and", "or", or "but". If they are related by cause and effect, use a subordinating conjunction like "because", "so", or "since". Once you have identified the relationship, insert the appropriate conjunction between the two sentences to create a compound sentence.
