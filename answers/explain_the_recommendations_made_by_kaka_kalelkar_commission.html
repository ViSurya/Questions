    The Kaka Kalelkar Commission, established in 1953, made several recommendations to improve the secondary education system in India. These included the introduction of a diversified curriculum, emphasis on practical and vocational subjects, the establishment of multipurpose schools, and the training of teachers in new methods of teaching. The commission also recommended the establishment of a National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to coordinate and promote research in education.
