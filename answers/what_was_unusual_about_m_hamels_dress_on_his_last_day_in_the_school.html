    On his last day at school, Monsieur Hamel wore an unusual attire that caught the attention of his students. Instead of his customary everyday clothes, he donned his finest attire, a long black frock coat, a frilled shirt, and a colorful sash. This formal attire symbolized the significance of the occasion and conveyed his deep respect for the French language and culture, which he had dedicated his life to teaching.
