    Unemployment is a significant issue affecting individuals, economies, and societies worldwide. It arises when people who are willing and able to work cannot find jobs. This problem has multiple causes, including economic downturns, technological advancements, and a lack of job creation. Unemployment can lead to poverty, social exclusion, and mental health issues. Governments and organizations are implementing various strategies to address unemployment, such as job training programs, entrepreneurship support, and infrastructure development. Tackling unemployment requires a comprehensive approach involving governments, businesses, and educational institutions to create job opportunities, enhance skills, and promote economic growth.
