    The soldier's reluctance to leave the shelter of the doctor's home stems from the comfort and safety he has found there. The doctor's home provides him with a sense of respite and protection from the horrors of war, allowing him to heal both physically and emotionally. Leaving this sanctuary would mean returning to the harsh realities of the battlefield, a prospect that fills him with fear and trepidation.
