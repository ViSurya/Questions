    In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 aces and 4 kings. Therefore, the total number of cards that are either an ace or a king is 4 + 4 = 8. Subtracting this value from the total number of cards in the deck (52), we find that there are 52 - 8 = 44 cards that are neither an ace nor a king. Thus, the probability of drawing a card that is neither an ace nor a king is 44/52 = 11/13.
