    Management levels are categorized based on the scope of authority and responsibility. Top-level management, also known as senior management, comprises the highest level of authority and is responsible for overall organizational goals, policies, and strategies. Middle-level management, also called tactical management, is responsible for implementing the plans and policies set by top-level management. Lastly, lower-level management, also known as operational management, is responsible for day-to-day operations and supervising employees.
