<ol class="ps-5 mb-2 max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-decimal list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
  <li class="mb-2"><b>Girder:</b> The girder is the main structural element of a bridge that supports the deck and carries the load. It is typically made of steel or concrete.</li>
  <li class="mb-2"><b>Deck:</b> The deck is the surface of the bridge that vehicles and people use. It is typically made of concrete or asphalt.</li>
  <li class="mb-2"><b>Abutment:</b> The abutment is the structure at each end of the bridge that supports the ends of the girder.</li>
  <li class="mb-2"><b>Pier:</b> The pier is a structure that supports the girder in the middle of the bridge. It is typically made of concrete or steel.</li>
  <li class="mb-2"><b>Pylon:</b> The pylon is a structure that supports the girder in a cable-stayed bridge. It is typically made of steel.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"><b><u>Working Principle of a Bridge:</u></b></p>

<p class="mb-2">A bridge works on the principle of transferring the weight of the traffic from the deck to the ground through the piers and abutments. The girder is designed to withstand the bending moment and shear forces that are generated by the traffic load.</p>

<p class="mb-2">The abutments and piers are designed to transfer the forces from the girder to the ground. The abutments are typically made of concrete or masonry, and they are buried below the ground. The piers are typically made of concrete or steel, and they are supported by foundations that are buried below the ground.</p>

<p class="mb-2">The type of bridge that is used depends on the size of the river or valley that it is crossing, the amount of traffic that it is expected to carry, and the cost of construction.</p>
