    Gandhi agreed to a settlement of 25% refund to the farmers as a compromise to end the Champaran Satyagraha. He believed that this settlement would provide immediate relief to the farmers and also serve as a stepping stone for further reforms in the indigo industry. Gandhi recognized that a complete victory, demanding a 50% refund, might have led to a prolonged struggle and potentially violent consequences. By accepting the 25% refund, he aimed to demonstrate the power of nonviolent resistance and establish a foundation for future negotiations and improvements in the lives of the farmers.
