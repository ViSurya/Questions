    Aunt Jennifer is surrounded by the ordeals of a restrictive and oppressive marriage, symbolized by the "ringed" tigers on the wall. The word "ringed" is significant because it suggests that Aunt Jennifer is trapped and confined within the boundaries of her marriage, unable to break free from its suffocating grip.
