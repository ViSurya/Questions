    <b>1.</b> The mass of a moving particle is m and velocity is v, then its momentum is mv.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
    <b>2.</b> The rate of change of momentum is equal to the force acting on the particle.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
    <b>3.</b> The work done by a force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
    <b>4.</b> The potential energy of a particle in a conservative force field is equal to the negative of the work done by the force in moving the particle from infinity to the given point.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
    <b>5.</b> The total mechanical energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies.

  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
    <b>6.</b> The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a closed system remains constant.

    <b>7.</b> The momentum of a system of particles is conserved if there are no external forces acting on the system.

    <b>9.</b> The center of mass of a system of particles moves with a constant velocity if there are no external forces acting on the system.
