    Zitkala-Sa's statement, "Eating by formula was the first trial in that first day," signifies the rigid and regimented nature of her assimilation experience at the boarding school. The use of the word "formula" suggests a mechanical and impersonal approach to nourishment, devoid of any cultural or personal context. This highlights the school's attempt to erase her cultural identity and impose a standardized, Eurocentric diet upon her.
