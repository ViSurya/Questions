    Gandhi agreed to a settlement of 25 percent refund to the farmers because he believed that it was the best way to resolve the Champaran agrarian crisis and bring justice to the farmers who had been exploited by the British indigo planters. He recognized that a prolonged struggle would only cause further hardship for the farmers and that a compromise was necessary to achieve a peaceful resolution.
