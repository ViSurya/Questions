    Shares and debentures are both financial instruments used by companies to raise capital, but they differ in several key aspects:

    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Ownership:</strong> Shares represent ownership in a company, while debentures are a form of debt.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Return:</strong> Shareholders receive dividends, which are a share of the company's profits, while debenture holders receive interest payments, which are a fixed percentage of the principal amount.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Risk:</strong> Shares are considered riskier than debentures because their value can fluctuate with the company's performance, while debentures are generally considered safer because they are backed by the company's assets.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Maturity:</strong> Shares do not have a maturity date, while debentures typically have a fixed maturity date when the principal amount is repaid.
