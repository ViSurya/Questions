    Informal communication offers advantages like speed and flexibility, as it allows for quick decision-making and adaptation to changing circumstances. It also fosters a sense of camaraderie and belonging among employees, leading to improved morale and teamwork. However, it can also have disadvantages, such as a lack of documentation, which can result in misunderstandings and disputes, and the potential for misinterpretation due to the absence of formal channels.
