    Dear [Friend's Name],
    I hope this letter finds you well. As Diwali approaches, I wanted to share my thoughts on celebrating the festival without crackers.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    While crackers are a traditional part of Diwali celebrations, they come with several drawbacks. The loud noises and air pollution caused by crackers can be harmful to our health and the environment. Additionally, the use of crackers can lead to accidents and injuries.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Instead of crackers, we can celebrate Diwali in a more eco-friendly and safe manner. We can decorate our homes with lights, diyas, and rangolis. We can also exchange gifts and sweets with our loved ones. By choosing to celebrate Diwali without crackers, we can contribute to a healthier and safer environment for ourselves and future generations.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    I hope you will consider my suggestion and join me in celebrating a cracker-free Diwali.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Warm regards,
    [Your Name]
  </p>
