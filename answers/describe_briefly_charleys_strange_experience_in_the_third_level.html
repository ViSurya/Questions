    In the third level, Charley found himself in a strange and mysterious world. He encountered bizarre creatures, including a talking cat, a flying saucer, and a group of people who claimed to be from another planet. He also discovered that he had special powers, such as the ability to communicate with animals and control objects with his mind.
