Ethical hacking is a practice where individuals with a strong understanding of computer networks and security measures use their knowledge to identify potential security flaws and weaknesses in a system. These individuals, known as ethical hackers, work with the consent of the system owner to assess the security of their systems and networks, identify potential threats, and suggest appropriate security measures to mitigate these threats.

<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
Ethical hacking is often conducted by security professionals, system administrators, and network engineers to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, protect against unauthorized access, and maintain the overall security of the system. Ethical hackers use various tools and techniques to simulate attacks and gain unauthorized access to systems, just like malicious hackers would. However, the primary goal of ethical hackers is to identify these security flaws and report them to the system owner so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken.
