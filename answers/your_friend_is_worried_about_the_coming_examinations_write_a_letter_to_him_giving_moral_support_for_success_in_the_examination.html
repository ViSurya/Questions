    Dear [Friend's Name],
    I understand you're feeling anxious about the upcoming exams, but I want to assure you that with hard work and dedication, you'll surely succeed. Remember, exams are just a test of your knowledge and skills, and they don't define your worth as a person.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Focus on your studies, stay organized, and take breaks when needed. Don't let stress overwhelm you; instead, channel it into productive studying. Believe in yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for help if you need it. Good luck, and I'm confident you'll do great!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Best wishes,
    [Your Name]
  </p>
