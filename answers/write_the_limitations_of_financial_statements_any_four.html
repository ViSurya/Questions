    Financial statements have certain limitations that users should be aware of when making decisions based on them. These limitations include:
  </p>
  <ol class="ps-5 mt-2 max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-decimal list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Historical Cost Basis:</b> Financial statements are prepared using the historical cost basis, which means that assets are recorded at their original cost and not at their current market value. This can lead to assets being overstated or understated on the balance sheet.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Estimates and Judgments:</b> Financial statements are based on estimates and judgments made by management. These estimates and judgments can be subjective and can lead to errors in the financial statements.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Going Concern Assumption:</b> Financial statements are prepared on the going concern assumption, which means that the company is assumed to continue operating in the foreseeable future. If this assumption is not valid, the financial statements may not be accurate.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Limited Disclosure:</b> Financial statements only provide a limited amount of information about a company. They do not disclose all of the risks and uncertainties that the company faces, and they may not provide enough information for users to make informed decisions.
