    Mukeshs attitude towards his situation is one of acceptance and resilience, while Saheb's is one of anger and frustration. Mukesh understands that his situation is a result of his own actions and is willing to take responsibility for it, while Saheb blames others for his circumstances and refuses to take ownership of his role in them.
