      <b>Fertile River Valleys:</b>
      The region is home to fertile river valleys, such as the Mekong and Irrawaddy, which provide favorable conditions for agriculture and support dense populations.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Favorable Climate:</b>
      The tropical climate of South-East Asia, with abundant rainfall and warm temperatures, is conducive to year-round crop cultivation, leading to high agricultural productivity and supporting a large population.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Historical and Cultural Factors:</b>
      The region has a long history of settlement and cultural exchange, resulting in the development of densely populated urban centers and trade routes.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <b>Limited Land Area:</b>
      Compared to other regions, South-East Asia has a relatively small land area, which contributes to the concentration of population in certain areas.
