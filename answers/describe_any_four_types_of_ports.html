      <strong>Natural Ports:</strong>
      These ports are formed by natural features like bays, inlets, or estuaries, providing shelter and protection to ships from harsh weather and strong currents.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Artificial Ports:</strong>
      These ports are constructed by humans to accommodate larger vessels and handle increased cargo traffic. They often involve dredging, breakwaters, and other infrastructure to create a safe and efficient port environment.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Inland Ports:</strong>
      These ports are located along rivers or canals, allowing ships to transport goods to and from inland areas. They play a crucial role in connecting remote regions to major transportation networks.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      <strong>Specialized Ports:</strong>
      These ports are designed to handle specific types of cargo or serve particular industries. Examples include oil terminals, container ports, and fishing ports, each equipped with specialized facilities and infrastructure to efficiently handle their respective cargo.
