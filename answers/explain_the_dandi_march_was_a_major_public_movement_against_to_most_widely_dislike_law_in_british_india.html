    The Dandi March, led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930, was a significant public movement against the Salt Act, which was widely disliked in British India. The Salt Act imposed a tax on the production and sale of salt, a basic necessity for all Indians, making it unaffordable for many. Gandhi's march aimed to challenge this unjust law and promote civil disobedience, inspiring millions of Indians to join the struggle for independence.
