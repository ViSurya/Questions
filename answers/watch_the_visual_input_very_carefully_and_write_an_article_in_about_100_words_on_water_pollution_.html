    Water pollution is a major environmental issue that affects the quality of water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. It occurs when harmful substances, such as chemicals, sewage, and industrial waste, are released into water sources, contaminating them and making them unsafe for drinking, swimming, and other recreational activities. Water pollution can also harm aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems.
