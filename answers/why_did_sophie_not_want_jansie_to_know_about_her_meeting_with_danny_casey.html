    Sophie didn't want Jansie to know about her meeting with Danny Casey because she was afraid that Jansie would disapprove of her actions and judge her for meeting with a man she barely knew. She also feared that Jansie would try to stop her from seeing Danny again, which would cause conflict between them.
