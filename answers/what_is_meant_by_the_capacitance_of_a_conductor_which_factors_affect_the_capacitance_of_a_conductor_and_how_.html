    Capacitance of a conductor refers to its ability to store electrical charge. It is directly proportional to the amount of charge it can hold and inversely proportional to the potential difference across it. Factors affecting capacitance include the size and shape of the conductor, the distance between conductors, and the type of insulating material between them. Larger conductors, closer proximity, and better insulating materials generally result in higher capacitance.
