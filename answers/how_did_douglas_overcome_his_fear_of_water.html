    Douglas overcame his fear of water through a gradual process of exposure and positive reinforcement. He started by simply wading into the shallow end of the pool, then gradually increased the depth of the water as he became more comfortable. He also practiced swimming with the help of a coach, who provided encouragement and support. As Douglas's skills and confidence improved, his fear of water diminished, and he was eventually able to swim without any anxiety.
