    The poet has used the expression "Sour Cream" to describe the classroom walls to convey a sense of dullness, monotony, and lack of inspiration. The color sour cream is often associated with blandness and a lack of flavor, which reflects the poet's perception of the classroom environment as uninspiring and stifling. This imagery suggests that the classroom walls are devoid of any vibrancy or creativity, creating a sterile and unwelcoming atmosphere for learning.
