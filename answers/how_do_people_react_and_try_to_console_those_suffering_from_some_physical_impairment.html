    When encountering individuals with physical impairments, people often display a range of reactions and attempts to provide comfort and support. Some may express empathy and concern, offering words of encouragement and support. Others might offer practical assistance, such as helping with tasks or providing accessible resources. Additionally, some individuals may engage in acts of kindness, such as offering a helping hand or providing emotional support.
