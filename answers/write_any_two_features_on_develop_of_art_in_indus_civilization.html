    The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in the Indus River Valley region of the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the world's earliest civilizations, dating back to 3300-1300 BCE. The art of the Indus Civilization is characterized by its unique style and craftsmanship.

    Two notable features of the art of the Indus Civilization are the use of seals and the depiction of animals. Seals were used for administrative purposes and often featured intricate designs and motifs. Animals were frequently depicted in art, both in realistic and stylized forms. These depictions provide valuable insights into the cultural and religious beliefs of the Indus Valley people.
