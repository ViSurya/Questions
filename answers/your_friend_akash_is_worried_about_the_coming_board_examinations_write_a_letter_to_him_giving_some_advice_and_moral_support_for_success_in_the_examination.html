    Dear Akash,
    I understand you're feeling anxious about the upcoming board exams, but I want to assure you that with proper preparation and a positive mindset, you can achieve success.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Firstly, create a study schedule that works for you and stick to it consistently. Make sure to allocate sufficient time for each subject and take regular breaks to avoid burnout.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Secondly, focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing facts. Utilize past papers and sample questions to familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and question types.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Lastly, stay positive and believe in yourself. Remember, these exams are a test of your knowledge and skills, not your worth as a person. Stay calm, confident, and give it your best shot.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Good luck, Akash! I'm confident you'll do great.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Best regards,
    [Your Name]
