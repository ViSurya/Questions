    <b>India's Arguments:</b> India claims that Kashmir is an integral part of India and that the accession of the state to India in 1947 was legal and valid. India also argues that Pakistan has no right to interfere in Kashmir's affairs and that the people of Kashmir have the right to determine their own future.

    <b>Pakistan's Arguments:</b> Pakistan claims that Kashmir is a disputed territory and that the people of Kashmir have the right to self-determination.
