    Dear Amar,
    I hope this letter finds you in high spirits. As you know, the JEE Mains exams are approaching, and I wanted to share some tips to help you prepare effectively.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Firstly, it's crucial to create a well-structured study plan that allocates sufficient time to each subject. Make sure to cover all the important topics and practice regularly to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, take advantage of online resources, such as mock tests and previous year's question papers, to assess your progress and identify areas where you need more improvement.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Remember to take breaks during your study sessions to avoid burnout and maintain focus. Lastly, stay positive and confident throughout the preparation process. Believe in your abilities, and don't let setbacks discourage you. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve your desired results.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    All the best for your exams, Amar!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Warm regards,
    [Your Name]
