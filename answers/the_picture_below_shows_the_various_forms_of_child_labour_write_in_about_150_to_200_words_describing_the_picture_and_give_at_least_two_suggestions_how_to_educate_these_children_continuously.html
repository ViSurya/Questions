    The picture depicts the unfortunate reality of child labor, where young individuals are forced to work in hazardous and exploitative conditions. These children are deprived of their basic rights to education, play, and a carefree childhood.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    To address this issue, it is crucial to implement strict laws against child labor and ensure their enforcement. Additionally, providing free and accessible education, along with vocational training programs, can empower these children with skills and knowledge to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation.
